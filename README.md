My 34th assignment! This assignment is a further extension on the fake tech website I have been working on. Many of the things required are already done, so I tried to elevate things where I could and fix bugs.

Assignment 1  
1. I implemented a reactive bootstrap nav bar and even went a step further, adding sticky functionality so that it would never scroll off screen if you scroll past it.    
2. I am already using bootstrap cards in multiple spots such as the footer, features, and services sections. So, I opted to spruce up some of the cards, in particular some of the margin/padding as well as adding gradients, text and border colors to the 'features' section.   
3. As I was already using bootstrap to style my buttons, I decided to add a new one to the navbar. I like the outline buttons a lot, so I'm glad to use it here. Additionally, I used an override for that button's styling so that when it is hovered it changes the font color to black so that the constrast is maintained. Otherwise, it'd be blue on blue. I actually learned here that you can continue the css target through the states, such as button:hover>a to only affect the a tag when the button is hovered which is what I wanted.
